# CONFIGURATION FILE for contact maps clustering algorithm
# !!! IMPORTANT !!! Do not change variables order, correct order is:
# contact_treshold, energy_treshold, method, optimal_ordering, truncation, truncate_mode,
# color_threshold, orientation, distance_sort, show_leaf_counts, rangeK, toll, max_iter

# CONTACT MAPS FILTERING
# residues in contact with a distance above the threshold are not considered
contact_treshold = 5

# residues with an energy bond below the threshold are not considered
energy_treshold = 7

# DENDROGRAM CONFIGURATIONS
# type of linkage, acceptable values: single, complete, average, weighted, centroid, median, ward
method = single

# if True, the linkage matrix will be reordered so that the distance between successive leaves
# is minimal (might become computationally expensive), acceptable values: True, False
optimal_ordering = False

# value for truncate mode, acceptable values: Integer
truncation = 50
# condenses the dendrogram if it's difficult to read, acceptable values: 'none', 'lastp', 'level',
# meaning: no truncation; the last p non-singleton clusters formed in the linkage are the only
# non-leaf nodes in the linkage; no more than 'truncation' levels of the dendrogram are displayed.
# A “level” includes all nodes with 'truncation' merges from the last merge.
truncate_mode = none

# colors all the descendent links below a cluster node the same color if is the first node below
# the cut threshold, acceptable values: float (with .)
color_threshold = 3.0

# the direction to plot the dendrogram, acceptable values: top, bottom, left, right
orientation = top

# for each node n, the order (visually, from left-to-right) n’s two descendent links are plotted
# is determined by this parameter, acceptable values: False, ascending or True, descending
distance_sort = descending

# when True, leaf nodes representing original observation are labeled with the number of observations
# they contain in parentheses, acceptable values: True or False
show_leaf_counts = True


# OPTIMAL CLUSTERING CONFIGURATIONS
# acceptable values: a range 'x to y' in which to search for the optimal value or a single value 5
# corresponding to the number of clusters we want to have for the clustering
rangeK = 3

# tollerance between the distance from an old center and a new one, acceptable values: float (with .)
toll = 0.001

# maximum number of iterations, acceptable values: Integer
max_iter = 300
